# Division-by-Invariant-Multiplication-Calc
A Division by Invariant Multiplication Calculator I made to help me make C and C++ programs run a bit faster.

A bit ago I discovered that you can make programs run faster at least on ARM Processors by using Division by Invariant Multiplication. 

I made this tool for personal use but figured I would upload it in case anyone else can make use of it.
